<p> <br>Once upon a younger year
    <br>When all our shadows disappeared
    <br>The animals inside came out to play
    <br>Went face to face with all our fears
    <br>Learned our lessons through the tears
    <br>Made memories we knew would never fade
<br>
    <br>One day, my father, he told me
    <br>"Son, don't let it slip away"
    <br>He took me in his arms, I heard him say
    <br>"When you get older
    <br>Your wild heart will live for younger days
    <br>Think of me if ever you're afraid"
<br>
    <br>He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind
    <br>So live a life you will remember"
    <br>My father told me when I was just a child
    <br>"These are the nights that never die"
    <br>My father told me
<br>
    <br>"When thunderclouds start pouring down
    <br>Light a fire they can't put out
    <br>Carve your name into those shining stars"
    <br>He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores
    <br>Don't forsake this life of yours
    <br>I'll guide you home no matter where you are"
<br>
    <br>One day, my father, he told me
    <br>"Son, don't let it slip away"
    <br>When I was just a kid, I heard him say
    <br>"When you get older
    <br>Your wild heart will live for younger days
    <br>Think of me if ever you're afraid"
<br>
    <br>He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind
    <br>So live a life you will remember"
    <br>My father told me when I was just a child
    <br>"These are the nights that never die"
    <br>My father told me
<br>
    <br>"These are the nights that never die"
    <br>My father told me
    <br>My father told me

    <br>Everybody is going to the party
    <br>Have real good time
<br>
    <br>Dancing in the desert
    <br>Blowing up the sunshine
<br>
    <br>Everybody is going to the party
    <br>Have a real good time
    <br>
    <br>Dancing in the desert
    <br>Blowing up the sunshine

    <br>You were the shadow to my light
    <br>Did you feel us
    <br>Another start
    <br>You fade away
    <br>Afraid our aim is out of sight
    <br>Wanna see us
    <br>Alive
<br>
    <br>Where are you now
    <br>Where are you now
    <br>Where are you now
    <br>Was it all in my fantasy
    <br>Where are you now
    <br>Were you only imaginary
    <br>Where are you now
<br>
    <br>Atlantis
    <br>Under the sea
    <br>Under the sea
    <br>Where are you now
    <br>Another dream
    <br>The monsters running wild inside of me
<br>
    <br>I'm faded
    <br>I'm faded
    <br>So lost
    <br>I'm faded
<br>
    <br>These shallow waters, never met
    <br>What I needed
    <br>I'm letting go
    <br>A deeper dive
    <br>Eternal silence of the sea
    <br>I'm breathing
    <br>Alive
<br>
    <br>Where are you now
    <br>Where are you now
<br>
    <br>Under the bright
    <br>But faded lights
    <br>You set my heart on fire
    <br>Where are you now
    <br>Where are you now
    <br>Where are you now
    <br>
    <br>Where are you now
    <br>Where are you now
    <br>Atlantis
    <br>Under the sea
    <br>Under the sea
    <br>Where are you now
    <br>Another dream
    <br>The monsters running wild inside of me
    <br>I'm faded
    <br>I'm faded
    <br>So lost
    <br>I'm faded
